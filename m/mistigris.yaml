biography: "Mistigris (pronounced \"misty-gree\") was an artscene group founded in
  late\n1994 by @Cthulu of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThe group primarily
  operated out of BBSes within the city's area code of 604\n(with a significant outpost
  in Quebec's 418 area code) joined across suburbs\nand provinces by the group's echomail
  network known as KiTSCHNet. In addition\nto numerous music disks and issues of their
  house diskmag KiTHE, among other\none-off projects, Mistigris released thirty-five
  artpacks between October\n1994 and June 1998.\n\nThe group emerged to fill a vacuum
  left by the collapse of local supergroup\n#iMPERiAL in September 1994, immediately
  striving against the similar efforts\nof competing local groups #RAiD and #Wild.Buffalo.Tamerz
  (WBT). While these\ncompetitors ceased operations in fairly short order, in #RAiD
  the foundations\nwere laid for the January 1995 founding of ANSI-only supergroup
  #Integrity --\nan immensely popular project which would serve to be an ongoing slow
  leak\ndeflating MiST of its upper-level ANSI artists, leaving it primarily known\nfor
  its specialty focus on tracked music and \"lit\", mediums generally\noverlooked
  or passed over by the artscene's text-graphics enthusiasts but\nleading Mistigris
  to its highest achievements in domination of the 1997\n\"#Blender\" IRC competitions.\n\nIn
  an attempt to address the rash of defections to #Integrity, Mistigris\nexperienced
  a tentative, abortive and ultimately unsuccessful merger with\nAmerican group #FiRE
  in March of 1995, and later a far more successful\nwholesale incorporation of local
  group #kRAP. Mist's history was also rife\nwith borrowings from postings and material
  created by members of the local\nTABNet (The Adopted Bastards Network) community.\n\nThinking
  outside of the box, in 1997 Mistigris engaged in what they called\nthe \"Mistigris
  World Tour\", where instead of releasing their members' art\nwithin their own packs,
  the artists released en masse in other groups as a\nvirtual tour of sorts. Groups
  who cooperated in this tour concept included\n#Blade, #Fire, #Dark and #Fistful.of.Steel
  (FOS). @Cthulu had plans to tour\nwith several smaller groups as well (#Ophidiac,
  #TeklordZ), to help mutually\nraise each others' profiles, but as he put it, \"the
  groups kept dying\" before\ntour arrangements could be finalized.\n\nMistigris itself
  ultimately came to a close in mid-1998 due to numerous\nfactors, among them mass
  graduation by its membership from high school into a\nworld of distractions, disagreements
  between department heads regarding\nquality control, and an ongoing inability to
  retain the membership of its\nmost talented active textmode artists. Proving most
  lethal, however, was the\nundermining and final collapse of the 604 area code's
  bizarrely long-lived\nBBS scene due to the new local availability of affordable
  dial-up internet\naccess â€” when Mist's first world headquarters The Screaming Tomato
  BBS\n(TST) went down, it was replaced in short order by The Jade Monkey (TJM), but\nwhen
  TJM went offline there was no longer anywhere relevant for the local\nmembers to
  call in to.\n\nIn its wake several former stalwart Mistigris members soldiered on
  as\n@Hallucigenia; @Cthulu, seeking a real-world equivalent to the dynamic and\ncreative
  artscene, began working for The Living Closet, lurking at the\nVancouver Poetry
  Slam, and started a long career in event production.\n"
