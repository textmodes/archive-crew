  Remorse was established in late 1994 by two IBM-PC scene ASCII artists from
  San Jose, California who went by the pseudonyms @Necromancer and @Necronite.

  While text-based art in a general sense is nothing new to speak of, Remorse
  is considered to be one of the earliest organized bodies created solely for
  creating ASCII art, second only to #Katharsis In that respect, #Katharsis was
  to ASCII what #Aces.of.ANSI.Art (AAA) was to ANSI, so one could argue that
  Remorse is the ACiD of ASCII.

  After releasing five (5) artpacks between 1994-1995, Remorse temporarily
  disbanded. Prominent members each went their separate ways; some created
  their own groups (such as #Trank) and another joined ANSI Creators in Demand
  to assist with their ASCII division.

  In 1996, it was decided by the leaders of #Trank, ACiD proper, and the newly
  formed #ACiD!ASCII division (not yet named Remorse) that they should
  consolidate (and in some ways reunite) as a single group. Like pHluid, the
  music sublabel of ACiD, the leaders of these three organizations merged
  together under the new name of Remorse/#ACiD!ASCII, and became an official
  extension of #ACiD.Productions. This is the Remorse which continues to exist
  to this day (1996-2005).
