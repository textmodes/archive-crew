biography: |
  Superior Art Creations, often referred to as SAC, is an underground artscene
  group which caters primarily to and is well known within the warez scene. SAC
  originated as a German-based art group, founded in December of 1994 by six
  members: @Dream.Design, @Kaethe, @Raiser, @Toxic.Trancer and the two
  legendary artists @Hetero and @Roy, with @Roy acting as the primary organizer
  of the group.

  During the mid to late nineties most of the notable ANSI artscene groups had
  distanced themselves from the warez scene, rather creating art for the sake
  of art, or for bulletin boards that were purely artscene related. Seizing
  this opportunity, SAC moved into this vacant territory and quickly became
  recognized as the leading group of warez scene artists. Towards the late
  1990s, a good majority of NFO file ASCII art was created by various members
  of SAC. In 1999, lead ASCII artist @Ferrex ascended into the role of senior
  staff and leader, continuing to control the group to this day.

  Now a globally operating organization, SAC employs approximately 40 artists
  and programmers worldwide and continues to be one of the leading groups
  creating art for the warez scene.
