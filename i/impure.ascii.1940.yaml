  Impure ASCII, also known as Impure ASCII 1940 is an ASCII art group founded
  in January of 1998 by two artists from Canada who went by the pseudonyms The
  Genocidal Servant (nicknamed @tEEGE and formerly known as @Incesticide) and
  @Helter.Skelter. The five original members of the group were @Dark.Stalker,
  @Helter.Skelter, @Mystic.Rage, @Shypht and The Genocidal Servant.

  Impure was a result of a merger between Canadian ANSI art group #Gel and the
  ASCII art division of Norwegian / American group #WOE.Productions (also known
  as WOE!ASCII). Shortly after its formation, the majority of the Canadian
  members, including the leader, abandoned the group leaving Impure without
  direction. The founder of WOE, @pOGUE, met up with @xZiP (a.k.a. @Hellbeard)
  and took over the responsibilities of the group.
